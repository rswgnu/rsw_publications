Archive of some major software documentation by Robert Weiner:

1. [Hyperbole](GNU-Hyperbole) - The Everyday Hypertextual Information Manager

`GNU Hyperbole` (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee) offers
context-sensitive mouse and keyboard keys that do the right thing, a
powerful contact manager, an advanced, auto-numbered outliner with
hyperlink anchors for each outline cell, and easily editable and
extensible hyperlink buttons, even embeddable within mail and news
messages.


2. [OO-Browser](GNU-OO-Browser) - The Multi-language Object-Oriented Code Browser

The `GNU OO-Browser` (pronounced Ga-new owe-owe-browse-er) is a
multi-windowed, interactive, object-oriented class browser designed
for professional use.  It is one of the world's most powerful tools
for exploring and developing object-oriented software.  Its user
interface is a bit like the well-known Smalltalk browsers,
yet its commands are more flexible and easier to use.

The OO-Browser has a number of exceptional features:

   - It presently supports seven object-oriented languages (C++,
     CLOS/Lisp, Eiffel, Java, Objective-C, Python and Smalltalk), one
     non-object-oriented language (C), and one documentation language
     (GNU Info).

   - It is fast and works exclusively from the source code of libraries
     and programs to be browsed.  Hence, it does not require a compiler.

   - It may be used for both system exploration and maintenance as part
     of a professional software development tool chest.

   - It quickly displays views of several important object-oriented
     relationships, over large sets of classes, not just a single class
     at a time.

   - It has a completely direct-manipulation interface with multiple
     modalities.

   - It is integrated with a powerful editing environment that can be
     customized to meet personal work styles.


3. [PIEs](PIEs) - Personalized Information Environments

`Personalized Information Environments` were conceived as a research project
to bring a set of powerful point tools and contextual managers that integrated
with the tools to modern software development.  A mail reader tool (PIEmail)
and a hypertextual manager (Hyperbole) were implemented to demonstrate the
possibilities, as described in the research thesis here.
